An incumbent can have static ambition or not, and can be renominated or not. In the resulting 2x2 matrix, cell c is always empty---the assumption is that an incumbent will not be renominated against her will. Cells a, b, and d distinguish, respectively, incumbents who retired, incumbents who were pushed out of the race (somehow prevented from running again), and incumbents who reran for another term in office.

One obstacle in the analysis is that, in most cases in the data, incumbents in cells a and b are confounded. We know that the did not run again, but whether they were forced out or chose to retire remains, unfortunately, unknown. Subsets a and b come in a joint ab category.

I distinguish periods 1, 2, and 3, each adding a subindex to these categories. Period 1 is pre-2018: before the reform and also before the party system collapsed. Observations in period 1 all belong in the ab_1 category. Period 2 is post-2018, after the party system collapse, but in states before the reform kicked in. Again, all observations in period 2 belong in the ab_2 category. Period 3 is post-2018 in states after the reform kicked in. Observation here belong in categories ab_3 and d_3.

Four incumbency curse models are estimated, each on different subsets of observations:

model 1: REPLICA on ab_1

model 2: PREKICK (POST-AMLO REPLICA) on ab_2

model 3: POSTKICK ab_3 and d_3

model 4: ALL (BLOG all obs) ab_1 ab_2 ab_3 and d_3

# model 5: ALLAMLO (POST-AMLO all obs) ab_2 ab_3 and d_3

# model 6: NONREF ab_1 and ab_2 in hgo and ver only

Garfias' suggestion involves verifying that model 4 results hold in model 3 and that model 1 results hold in model 2. If so, then the with/out incumbent contrast in models 3 and 4 becomes more convincing.
